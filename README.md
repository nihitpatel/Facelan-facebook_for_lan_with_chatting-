# Facelan-facebook_for_lan_with_chatting-


open facelan in Java Netbeans IDE

This project is only for educational purpose.
You will be able to run it but it will not function correctly. The program is correct but as it is implemented in 
java and mysql, you will require mysql database and table with the same structure that i used and that structure i m not going to share.  

I made this project for my sem 3rd DBMS subject.
